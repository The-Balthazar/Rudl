The word is chosen based on your system clock, and the game has no memory of you having played it more than once, so if you wanted you could easily cheat. About on the level of using incogneto mode on Wordle.

The keyboard is just for visualisation, and isn't a functional input.

If you win you can press `c` to copy a shareable pile of emojis. It doesn't work if you lose. I guess I assumed you'd want to hide your shame.
